The current version of the PT specification is v3.0. It is available, along with requests for modifications, at [this page on Github](https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec).

Pluggable Transports are a concept developed by The Tor Project that provide ways to protect your data from aggressive censorship techniques, and can be included in a variety of tools. The Tor Project authored the [original Pluggable Transports specification](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/pt-spec.txt) for use in the tor network environment.

In 2015 and 2016, a series of meetings of current transport developers and implementers circumvention tools met to determine broader, community requirements on what would be useful in a revised Pluggable Transports specification. These led to three proposals that were later merged into a draft specification for version 2.
