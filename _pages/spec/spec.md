Pluggable Transports are a concept developed by The Tor Project that provide ways to protect data from aggressive censorship techniques, and can be included in a variety of tools. The Tor Project authored the [original Pluggable Transports specification](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/pt-spec.txt) for use in the tor network environment. 

In 2015 and 2016, a series of meetings with current transport developers and implementers of circumvention tools were held to determine broader community requirements for a revised Pluggable Transports specification. These meetings led to three proposals, which were later merged into a draft specification for [version 2](https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec/tree/main/releases/PTSpecV2.2).

The current version of the PT specification is v3.0. It is available, along with requests for modifications, on [this Github page](https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec).

A list of releases up to January 2022 can be found [here](https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec/tree/main/releases).
