# Installing Bitmask mobile VPN with support for Pluggable Transports #

The Pluggable Transports team worked with [Calyx](https://calyx.net) to add Pluggable Transports support to their product, which is based on the [Bitmask](https://bitmask.net) VPN. As of March 2024, the [Bitmask](https://bitmask.net) VPN is available for android devices through Google Play download, and for desktop clients ([Linux](https://bitmask.net/en/install/linux)/Windows/MacOS) itâ€™s available by installing RiseupVPN.

For android devices unable to install Bitmask VPN from the Google Play Store, the video on this page guides you through the steps of installing [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), downloading and installing the app, and configuring it to use Pluggable Transports.
