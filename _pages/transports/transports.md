There are many different transports which address a wide variety of blocking strategies. At a very high-level standpoint, they can be grouped into three strategies: Diverting, Scrambling and Shapeshifting.

## Diverting/Fronting

In this case, traffic is moved around the network using different paths to standard web traffic. One way of diverting traffic is known as "domain fronting". This approach leverages cloud platforms which are socially or economically difficult to block - it pushes traffic through a "front", which is commonly an IP address shared by many sites on the cloud provider. To effectively block an app using domain fronting requires blocking the entire cloud provider -- and every other service hosted by it. This approach has been less successful in the past couple of years, due to large cloud providers removing the ability to front using their services.

While domain fronting was a popular method, leveraging cloud platforms to disguise the origin of traffic, as well as changes in cloud provider policies have significantly reduced its viability. As a result, the focus has shifted towards more dynamic and resilient methods:

- Bridges and Relays: Utilizing a network of bridges and relays that can be rapidly deployed and decommissioned. This approach relies on a distributed network of volunteers or automated systems to provide fresh entry points, making it harder for censors to block all access without significant collateral damage.

- Ephemeral Bridges: Emphasizing the use of short-lived, often automated bridges that adapt to censorship efforts by frequently changing, making it challenging for censors to maintain an up-to-date list of blocked addresses.

## Scrambling

This approach seeks to disguise the traffic in ways that are not identifiable as any specific type of traffic. This forces an adversary to only allowed whitelisted traffic (which can be easily defeated by fronting) or to expend significant resources to re-identify the scrambled traffic. Scrambling tends to work best where there is not only a willingness to outright block large platform providers, but also to take part in DPI analysis of internet traffic.

Scrambling relies on having clients being able to know or discover unblocked IP addresses, and an active censor will work to discover and block these addresses. Once a server address is known it is no longer usable.

Given those vulnerabilities, scrambling techniques have evolved to be more sophisticated, employing advanced cryptographic methods to make traffic appear indistinguishable from normal internet noise, which has proven to be particularly effective against Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):

- Adaptive Protocols: Implementing protocols that can adapt their obfuscation patterns based on the detected level of censorship, ensuring that the traffic remains unidentifiable over time.

- Protocol Camouflage: Using the characteristics of commonly allowed protocols (e.g., HTTPS, QUIC) to camouflage the traffic, making it blend in with regular internet traffic and harder for censors to justify blocking without affecting normal internet usage.

## Shapeshifting

"Shapeshifting" hides the traffic in non-objectional formats, making it look like a VOIP call, web traffic, online games, or statistically sampled "normal" traffic. This approach defeats whitelisted traffic limitations, but is almost impossible to do "perfectly" -- even if the traffic is indistinguishable from "real" traffic, the client and server will generally behave differently from a "real" server - meaning that advanced adversaries can choose to expend resources to do follow-up scans on every suspected connection to verify the server acts "correctly," and block it if not.

Currently, shapeshifting has advanced beyond simple mimicry of non-controversial traffic types, incorporating machine learning and AI to dynamically adapt to the evolving landscape of internet traffic:

- AI-Driven Mimicry: Leveraging artificial intelligence to continuously analyze patterns of allowed traffic and adapt the obfuscated traffic to match, making it increasingly difficult for censors to distinguish between genuine and circumvented traffic.

- Behavioral Mimicry: Focusing not just on the appearance of the traffic but also on mimicking the behavioral patterns of legitimate traffic, such as the timing of requests, the size of data packets, and typical user interactions, to withstand more in-depth analysis by advanced adversaries.


## Current Implementations

| **Transport** | **Information** | **Strategy** |
|----|-------|

|**[meek](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/meek)**| For a long time, Meek was considered the gold standard as it supported domain fronting through Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. It is now used much less frequently, and only when allowed by the cloud provider. | Diverting (domain fronting) |

|**[SnowFlake](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/snowflake)**| SnowFlake uses WebRTC to turn website visitors into ephemeral proxies. See also [Snowflake's website](https://snowflake.torproject.org/). As Snowflake use increases, more Snowflake bridges will need to be built and discoverability of these bridges will be the key to its success. | Diverting |

|**[Refraction Networking](https://refraction.network/)**| This approach involves intercepting traffic at the ISP or network operator level, and redirecting traffic from perceived "safe" addresses to user-requested, blocked content. It increases the cost of censorship, by preventing censors from selectively blocking only those servers used to provide Internet freedom. | Diverting |

|**[obfs4](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/obfs4)**| Obfs4 is the current state of the art deployed "look-like nothing" obfuscation protocol from The Tor Project. It evolved from [obfs2](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt) and [obfs3](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt) to include active probing defences, and is in wide use today. Tor have published and unpublished bridges, increasing the effort needed by the adversary to block them. | Scrambling |

|**[Dust](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/dust)**| Dust transforms traffic to statistically match a pattern of "allowed" traffic | Shapeshifting |

|**[Stegotorus](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/stegotorus)**| A development framework that provides an API specifically geared towards the needs of steganographic protocols. With this API, developers can help applications hide from DPI, and to resist throttling or connection dropping. | Shapeshifting |

|**[Lampshade](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/lampshade)**| An obfuscated encrypted network protocol for [Lantern](https://getlantern.org) | Shapeshifting |

|**[Optimizer](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/optimizer)**| A pluggable transport that works with other transports to find the best option by making use of multiple configurable strategies to find the optimal choice among the available transports. | Various |

|**[Replicant](https://software.pluggabletransports.info/replicant)**| An "adversary-tunable" transport that can be adapted to provide the obfuscation needed by any specific adversary. | Shapeshifting |

The continuous evolution of these techniques and transports reflects the ongoing arms race between censors and developers of circumvention tools, highlighting the importance of continuous innovation in PT strategies to adapt to the ever-changing tactics employed by censors.

Now that you know what transports are available, let's look at how to [make sure they're working](/measuring).
