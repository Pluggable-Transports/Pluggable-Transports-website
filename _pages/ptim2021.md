# The Pluggable Transports Implementers' Meeting is a bi-annual event that brings together hackers, technologists, academics, and community from a variety of companies and organizations to solve pressing issues related to Internet security, anti-censorship strategies, and the open internet.

## You Can Look Forward To:
Get excited for the 2021 virtual PTIM! We'll bring together the Pluggable Transport (PT) community to discuss the latest on censorship circumvention technology.  You'll hear from experts on measurement, talks on user experiences with circumvention tools, the latest developments to PTs such as Snowflake, policy impacts, and more! This event will feature panels, lightening talks, regional sessions, and hacking sessions to provide a unique and collaborative experience for everyone. Stay tuned for the complete schedule, to be posted in early October.
