Want to build your own transport or adapt a system you already have working to be a Pluggable Transport?  Great!

* Adapting an existing system? Start by checking out the [PT2 Specification](/spec/) and learn about [Dispatcher](/implement/)
* Want to build a new transport?  Keep reading!

## Current Transports

Read through the [Transports Library](/transports/) to see current transports and approaches to the problem.  Specifically, reading through the **evaluations** of popular transports will help understand and identify common challenges. You can read the [Evaluation Criteria](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/PTEvaluationCriteria).

Tor's [Pluggable Transport Documentation](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports) contains years of compiled wisdom.

## Current challenges

Our brief history of censorship's sections on [DPI filtering and advanced censorship](/how/#dpi-blocking) will help you begin to understand what you're up against.  

Tor's [expectations for inclusion into the Tor Browser Bundle](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/GuidelinesForDeployingPTs) and the [Evaluation Criteria](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/PTEvaluationCriteria) for transports also provide valuable code and quality and practice expectations for being a responsible actor in this space.
