General conference engagement notes:

- For group sessions, we will be using [Big Blue Button,](https://bigbluebutton.org/privacy/) an open source web conferencing platform.
- We may occasionally send you emails with [Mailchimp,](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) a transactional email service.
- For RSVPs, we use [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/GcNjAWmK6YDB3EO2IipRZ0fUe89j43Ryqeb4fjkjehE/).
- For notetaking, we use [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/privacy.html).

## Session policies:

- **Participation in the PTIM requires an invitation and RSVP.** Due to the conference&#39;s narrow scope and expectation of privacy, the audience is only the Pluggable Transports community and members of the circumvention technology community.
- Unless otherwise stated, PTIM sessions will follow the [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) in terms of notetaking, video recording, and any other form of recording that may take place during the conference.
  - **This rule states:** When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.
- Presenters will be given the option to record their sessions. If a session is recorded, this will be clearly stated to participants. Chat and participant logs will not be shared.
- While we do not ask that you use your real name, we do ask that you identify yourself to organizers.

For other privacy concerns, please see our Code of Conduct, the Internews Privacy Policy, and the [Internews data retention policy](https://internews.org/data-retention-policy/). If you have any other questions, please reach out to [srizvi@internews.org](mailto:srizvi@internews.org).
