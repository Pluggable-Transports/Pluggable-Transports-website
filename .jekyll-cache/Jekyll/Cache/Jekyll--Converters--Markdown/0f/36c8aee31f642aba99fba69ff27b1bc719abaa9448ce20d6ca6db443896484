I"‚<p>Thereâ€™s been a big update to Redjackâ€™s <a href="https://www.github.com/redjack/marionette">Marionette</a> on Github. The repository, which contains a Go port of the programmable network proxy, has been updated to fix some issues with active probing defenses, and now also includes extensive documentation.</p>

<p>The docs give step-by-step instructions for using Marionette, from building simple â€œHello Worldâ€ protocols through to full application simulations. We have also published our own guide to installing both the <a href="/implement/marionette-server">server</a> and <a href="/implement/marionette-client">client</a>.</p>
