The wait is finally over! In October 2021, Internews held the 2021 Pluggable
Transports Implementerâ€™s Meeting. This convening brought together hackers,
technologists, academics, and community from a variety of organizations to
discuss and solve pressing issues related to Internet security, anti-censorship
strategies, and the open internet.

This event featured sessions on new circumvention technology, regional
sessions, lightening talks, and more. Now, you can view these sessions
[online](https://archive.org/details/ptim2021)! Whether you missed the event or
would like to rewatch your favorite session, the recorded sessions can be
viewed on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ptim2021).

Happy viewing!
