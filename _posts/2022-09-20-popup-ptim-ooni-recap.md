# Pop Up PTIM Session: RECAP

## Presented by Ain Ghazal ICFP @OONI

Thank you to all those who attended the Pop Up PTIM! For those of you who
missed it or want to refresh your memory, here is a short recap of the
presentation.

This session was presented by Ain Ghazal, a fellow at the Open Observatory of
Network Interference, titled "VPN Censorship, Probes, and Resilience: Building
Feedback Loops with Open Data".

The presentation focused on how OONI can help make VPNs better through OONI
probes and their world-wide network of volunteers, probing real-life networks.
Ghazal continued to explain the intricacies of this idea as well possible
setbacks such as adversaries having access to this kind of public information.
