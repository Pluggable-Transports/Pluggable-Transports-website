# Pop Up PTIM Session: VPN censorship, Probes and Resilience: Building Feedback Loops with Open Data

## Presented by OONI

We are excited to announce the next Pop Up PTIM Session! These are stand alone
sessions, allowing the community to discuss PT related topics and stay up to
date on the progress of this community.

Our next session will be presented by members of the Open Observatory of
Network Interference (OONI). This presentation will cover the ongoing efforts
to incorporate protocol-aware VPN probes into the OONI ecosystem.

This session will cover:

- The high level goals of the project (quantify network interference with VPN
  flows; both vanilla -which in principle is trivially fingerprintable- and
encrypted).
- Which kind of data analysis pipelines and APIs can be useful to researchers,
  protocol designers and service providers.
- How the planned probes & experiments can be further enriched to capture
  evolving realities in the circumvention arena.

This session will take place on **July 13th at 16:00 UTC/12:00 ET/18:00 CEST**.
