## Introduction 

Internews is excited to announce the new Pluggable Transports Monthly Meetup in
partnership with the Internet Freedom community! This meetup is intended to
give digital rights defenders the opportunity to meet the host(s) of the new
monthly meetup and ask questions. 

Pluggable Transports (PT) are developed to help developers keep their users
connected when censorship occurs. Anyone using tools to access censored content
on their network, such as the Tor browser or VPNs, is probably using PTs in the
background. This meetup aims to give users, developers, and PT enthusiasts the
opportunity to share their experiences and updates monthly.

## Meetup details

The meetup will take place October 14th, Thursday at 9am EST/1:00pm UTC. This
event will take place on the IFF Square on IFF Mattermost. Please find more
details on how to join
